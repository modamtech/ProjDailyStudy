            Good morning. I'd like to send a dozen pink roses to a friend of mine.#
            Do you deliver to Berkshire?
	    </sentence_p1>
	    <sentence_p2>
	    	Yes, we do, but there's an extra charge of fifteen pounds because it's outside our normal delivery zone.
	    </sentence_p2>
	    <sentence_p3>
            That's fine. I'd like them delivered on Friday morning to her office. I want to include a personal message#
            on the card, but I'd rather not come into your shop in person.
	    </sentence_p3>
	    <sentence_p4>
            That's not an issue. If you tell me what you want, I can write it for you.#
            Go ahead when you're ready.

            Good morning. I'm Seiko Nimiya from Delaney Tech. I'm scheduled to demonstrate#
            how to use our new video projection system to your sales team at 10 A.M.
	    </sentence_p1>
	    <sentence_p2>
            Yes, Ms. Nimiya. We're ready for you in conference room 3.#
            Do you need any assistance in unloading the equipment?
	    </sentence_p2>
	    <sentence_p3>
			Thanks, but I am fine. It's quite compact, so this cart is all I need.
	    </sentence_p3>
	    <sentence_p4>
            All right. And you should know that in addition to our sales team,#
            a few other managers have decided to sit in on your presentation.
	    </sentence_p4>
	    <sentence_p5>
	    	Great. The more people to see it, the better.

            Ms. Gilligan, thank you for this opportunity. You know, our creative department#
            loves your productsâ€”especially your colored pencils and sketchbooks.
	    </sentence_p1>
	    <sentence_p2>
            I'm glad to hear that. We enjoy your advertising campaigns.
	    </sentence_p2>
	    <sentence_p3>
            Thank you. Now, I'll be overseeing your account, but it will mainly be handled by# 
            Todd here. Todd, why don't you get the meeting started?#
	    </sentence_p3>
	    <sentence_p4>
            Sure, Alejandro. Ms. Gilligan, why did you decide to find a new advertising agency?
	    </sentence_p4>
	    <sentence_p5>
            I was disappointed by our previous agency's performance. They had good ideas,#
            but their campaigns were never ready on schedule.
	    </sentence_p5>
   	    <sentence_p6>
            I see. We'll take that into account. Now, if you don't mind, I have some questions#
            about your target market.
